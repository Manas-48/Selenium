RAFT loads are of two types based on requirement

Build to get the (download) customer data and sling (ftp) it over to the external location  

Here we are not bothered about the format of the data either its text or excel 

Build to get the (download) customer data, add an extra column to the end of the file and sling it over. 

Addition of extra column (data date) is done in order to know which day the data belongs to. 

Ex If a RAFT load is running on Tuesday node, we will add a data date (Monday) which will helps us to identify the data.
